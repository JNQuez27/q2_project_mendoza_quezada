    "title": "How to Fix a Capacitor on a Laptop Charger",
    "subtitle":
        "Fixing a capacitor on a laptop charger is a very technical process that requires knowledge of electronics and soldering. If you are not experienced, it's safer and more efficient to buy a new charger. However, if you are familiar with electronics, here are the steps to follow:",

    "videoPath": "images/vid2_phone.mp4",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: Disassemble the Charger",
      "• Safety First: Unplug the charger from both the wall and your laptop. Allow it to sit for at least 30 minutes to ensure any remaining charge in the capacitors is fully discharged.",
      "• Open the Case: The case of a laptop charger is usually sealed with strong adhesive. You will need a flat-head screwdriver, a pry tool, or a hobby knife to carefully and slowly pry open the plastic casing along the seam. This process can be difficult and may damage the case.",
      "Step 2: Locate the Faulty Capacitor",
      "• Visual Inspection: Once the case is open, you will see the circuit board. Look for capacitors that are bulging, leaking fluid, or appear discolored or burnt. A healthy capacitor should have a flat top and no residue.",
      "• Identify Type and Value: The capacitor will have its specifications printed on its side, including its capacitance (e.g., 1000 µF) and voltage rating (e.g., 16V). Note these details down as you will need to buy an exact replacement.",
      "Step 3: Remove the Old Capacitor",
      "• Prepare Your Tools: You will need a soldering iron, desoldering wick or a solder pump, and a pair of pliers.",
      "• Desolder the Leads: Heat the solder joints on the underside of the circuit board where the capacitor leads are connected. Use the desoldering wick or pump to remove the melted solder.",
      "• Remove the Capacitor: Once the solder is removed, gently wiggle the capacitor free with the pliers. Be careful not to damage the surrounding components or circuit board traces.",
      "Step 4: Install the New Capacitor",
      "• Observe Polarity: Capacitors are polarized components, meaning they must be installed in a specific direction. The negative lead is marked with a stripe on the side of the capacitor. The circuit board will also have a marking (often a shaded half-circle or a \"+\" sign) to indicate the correct orientation. Installing it backward will cause it to fail, often explosively.",
      "• Solder the New Capacitor: Insert the leads of the new capacitor into the correct holes on the circuit board, making sure the polarity is correct. Apply new solder to the joints to create a strong connection.",
      "• Trim the Leads: Use wire cutters to trim the excess leads from the underside of the board.",
      "Step 5: Test and Reassemble",
      "• Test the Charger: Before reassembling the case, carefully plug the charger into a power outlet (not your laptop) to check if the new capacitor is working correctly. You can use a multimeter to check the voltage output.",
      "• Seal the Case: If the charger is working, you can close the plastic case. You can use strong electrical tape or a small amount of super glue or epoxy to secure the case back together.",
